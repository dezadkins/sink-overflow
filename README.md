Sink Overflow's backend server was built using Express for Node and utilized the pug templating engine to serve static HTML. The server has a RESTful API layer for some of the more dynamic functionalities, such as voting and search. The server is connected to a PostgreSQL database which leverages sequelize and it's ORM for CRUD operations.

The front end uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS3 loaded from the HTML generated by pug to introduce some UI, UX, and styling.
