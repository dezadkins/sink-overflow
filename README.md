**Sink Overflow** is a platform for both home improvement questions and answers, modeled on [Stack Overflow] (https://www.stackoverflow.com/). It allows users to create questions, answers, and comments. It also uses RESTful API routes that allow users to vote on questions and answers, attach images to their questions, and search for questions.

## Demo

Here is a working live demo: [https://sink-overflow.herokuapp.com](https://sink-overflow.herokuapp.com)

## Application Architecture

<img src='./public/appArchitectureDiagram.png' align="center" alt="App Architecture Diagram" width="600">

Dependencies used
- bcrypt
- cookie-parser
- csurf
- dotenv
- faker.js 
- nodemon
- pug
- sequelize
- sequelize-cli
- express
- express-session
- express-validator
- node-postgres

Sink Overflow's backend server was built using Express for Node and utilized the pug templating engine to serve static HTML. The server has a RESTful API layer for some of the more dynamic functionalities, such as voting and search. The server is connected to a PostgreSQL database which leverages sequelize and it's ORM for CRUD operations.

The front end uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS3 loaded from the HTML generated by pug to introduce some UI, UX, and styling.

## Backend


#### Database

#### Auth

For authentication we used express session and bcrypt for password hashing. For authorization we attached the session to the response object through custom middleware and protected our routes by accessing the session. 

Below is an example of our basic auth functionality.

#### Search API

The search API is fairly simple and uses SQL wildcards to match search terms and question titles.

Below is an example of how our search API is working for the moment

#### Polymorphic Voting API

The voting api has separate routes for handling question votes and answer votes. The route handles CRUD operations through a single endpoint. This was achieved by checking the user's vote status on a question/answer before each operation. If a user has a vote and then tries to vote again it deletes the vote in the database, if a user changes their vote status from upvote to downvote the item is updated and if a user doesn't already have a vote, it is created. The bigger challenge was getting the DOM to respond to the API route and it's polymorphic nature.
